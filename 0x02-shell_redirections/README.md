## Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters
This directory contains files that test and showcase my understanding of shell input and output redirctions and filters. These are executable scripts that do the following;
- 0-hello_world: Prints 'Hello World" followed by a new line.
- 1-confused_smiley: Display the confused smiley "(Ã”o)'.
