## Shell Permissions
This directory contains executables files(scripts) that are meant to showcase my understanding of shell permissions. The files and their functions  are;
- 0-iam_betty: Change the userID to betty. Using exactly 8 characters for the command(+1 character for the new line), Assume betty will exist when the scrpt is run.
- 1-who_am_i: Print the effective userID of the current user.
- 2-groups: Print the group or groups the user is part of.
- 3-new_owner: Change the ownership of the file 'hello' to betty.
- 4-empty: Creates an empty file named 'hello'.
- 5-execute: Add execute permission for the the owner of the file 'hello'.
